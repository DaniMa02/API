# Proxmox API
This is an API created to manage Proxmox Virtual Environment.
I made it as my Higher Degree Thesis since I wanted to learn some JavaScript frameworks.
It provides an easy way to interact with Proxmox from any place as well as some features Proxmox does not provide such as bulk VM creation or delete, no need to unlock locked machines before removal.
I will add an Ansible provisioning tab in the API which will help the API to release updates or anything you need on all the machines or the ones you need.
All the selectable menus are dynamic meaning they will reload everytime something changes on the environment.
